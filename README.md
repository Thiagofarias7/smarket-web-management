## Getting Started
>You need to have installed Apache2, MariaDB and PHP, with mysqli extension, on your machine with the package manager of your distro linux (in this case, we used the Fedora35):
  ```sh
  $ sudo dnf install httpd
  $ sudo yum install -y mariadb mariadb-server
  $ sudo yum install php-cli php-mysqli
  ```
>For MariaDB and Git, you can found how in these docs:
>
>[Maria DB](https://mariadb.org/download/?t=mariadb&p=mariadb&r=11.3.0&os=Linux&cpu=x86_64&pkg=tar_gz&i=systemd&m=insacom)
>[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
  #### After that, clone this repository
  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/manuelzzz/smarket-web-management.git

  #### Then, go to the root of the project and run
  ```sh
  $ php -S localhost:8080 lib/index.php
  ```
  > When running with php-cli, go to http://server-ip:8080
  #### To discover the server ip, you do:
  ```sh
  $ ifconfig
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the /var/www/html/project-name instead php-cli to run the project direct in apache webserver
>
